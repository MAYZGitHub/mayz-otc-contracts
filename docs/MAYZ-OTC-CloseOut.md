## ðŸŒŸ Highlights & Achievements

* Created the first trustless OTC protocol on Cardano using NFT-bound trade offers.
* Adopted Aiken and Plutus V3, contributing to modern smart contract development.
* Engaged the Cardano community in testing and validating the protocol.
* Delivered everything open-source, from smart contracts to onboarding tools.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

* Aiken enables faster iteration and smoother testing compared to legacy Plutus.
* Starting with a clear architecture minimized rework and errors later.
* Phased deploymentâ€”testnet to Mainnetâ€”gave us valuable feedback loops.
* Strong documentation played a key role in developer and user adoption.

---

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps

* Perform a comprehensive security audit.
* Continue planning for Mainnet expansion based on user demand.
* Add integrations with popular wallets (Lace, Eternl) and Cardano DEXs.
* Seek partners and funding to expand liquidity support and extend use cases.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts

The MAYZ Trustless OTC Protocol represents a modular, reusable system for off-chain liquidity matching. By combining NFTs and validator logic into a seamless user experience, weâ€™ve created a new way to perform OTC trades transparently and securely. Thanks to Project Catalyst and the Cardano community for making this possible.

## ðŸ§© Functional Documentation

### 1. Smart Contract Functionality Explained

#### `create_offer`

* **Purpose**: Starts a new OTC deal by locking the userâ€™s tokens and minting a unique NFT.
* **How it works**: The user defines what they are offering and what they want in return. This data is stored in a smart contract UTxO.
* **Result**: The offer is now visible and active on-chain.

#### `accept_offer`

* **Purpose**: A counterparty accepts the offer by providing the required tokens.
* **How it works**: The taker sends the ask tokens and receives the offered tokens in return. The offer NFT is burned.
* **Result**: The deal is settled and closed.

#### `cancel_offer`

* **Purpose**: Allows the original offer creator to cancel and reclaim their tokens.
* **How it works**: The user must prove ownership via signature and the offer NFT.
* **Result**: The offer is closed and funds returned.

#### `redeem_after_timeout`

* **Purpose**: Acts as a safety net to recover funds if the offer expires.
* **How it works**: After the deadline, the original offerer can retrieve their tokens.

**NFT Minting Logic**:

* Minted NFT uniquely represents the offer.
* Enforced to be one per offer.
* Token name = `sha2_256(OfferDatum)`.

---

### 2. Security and Error Handling

* **Authorized Actions**: Only the offer creator can cancel. Acceptors must own the NFT.
* **Deadline Enforcement**: Offers cannot be accepted or cancelled after their expiration slot.
* **Value Checks**: Asset amounts must exactly match offer terms.
* **Failure Handling**: Invalid or expired actions automatically revert and preserve funds.
* **Off-Chain Checks**: Wallet interface checks validity before transactions are submitted.

---

### 3. Contract Independence

* The OTC system is completely self-contained.
* **No reliance on external contracts or oracles**.
* **Admin/Emergency Tokens**:

  * Minted using `cardano-cli` with a short expiry window.
  * Cannot be re-minted or burned; they cannot control user funds.

---

### 4. Wallet & Ecosystem Integration

* **Wallet Support**: Lace, Eternl, Nami, Gero (via Lucid & CIP-30).
* **Endpoints**:

  * `/api/otc/create`, `/claim`, `/close`, `/cancel`
  * Support full trade lifecycle: create, fulfill, close, cancel
* **Token Compatibility**:

  * Uses CIP-20 for tokens, CIP-25 for NFT metadata
  * CIP-47 inline datums and CIP-68 reference scripts improve cost-efficiency and indexing
* **Marketplace Ready**: NFTs can be displayed and traded on Cardano NFT platforms.

---

### 5. Upgrade Path & Versioning

* **Approach**: Every offer is managed individually, avoiding central dependencies.
* **Current Version**: `validatorV1` published in Aiken source
* **How Updates Work**:

  * Deploy `validatorV2` in future versions
  * Update script hash in off-chain config
  * No disruption to offers made under `validatorV1`
* **Governance Tokens**:

  * Immutable, no administrative override or upgrade backdoor
