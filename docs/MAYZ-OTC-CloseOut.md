## ðŸŒŸ Highlights & Achievements

- Created the first trustless OTC protocol on Cardano using NFT-bound trade offers  
- Adopted Aiken and Plutus V3, contributing to modern smart contract development  
- Engaged the Cardano community in testing and validating the protocol  
- Delivered everything open-source, from smart contracts to onboarding tools

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Aiken enables faster iteration and smoother testing compared to legacy Plutus  
- Starting with a clear architecture minimized rework and errors later  
- Phased deploymentâ€”testnet to Mainnetâ€”gave us valuable feedback loops  
- Strong documentation played a key role in developer and user adoption

---

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps

- Perform a comprehensive security audit  
- Continue planning for Mainnet expansion based on user demand  
- Add integrations with popular wallets (Lace, Eternl) and Cardano DEXs  
- Seek partners and funding to expand liquidity support and extend use cases

---

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts

The MAYZ Trustless OTC Protocol represents a modular, reusable system for off-chain liquidity matching. By combining NFTs and validator logic into a seamless user experience, weâ€™ve created a new way to perform OTC trades transparently and securely. Thanks to Project Catalyst and the Cardano community for making this possible.

## ðŸ§© Functional Documentation

### 1. Smart Contract Functionality Explained

#### `create_offer`
- **Purpose**: Starts a new OTC deal by locking the userâ€™s tokens and minting a unique NFT  
- **How it works**: User defines offered/ask terms. Stored in smart contract UTxO. `$MAYZ` token required to authorize creation  
- **Result**: Offer becomes active on-chain

#### `accept_offer`
- **Purpose**: A counterparty accepts by sending the required tokens  
- **How it works**: Taker sends ask tokens and receives offered tokens. NFT is burned  
- **Result**: Deal is executed and closed

#### `cancel_offer`
- **Purpose**: Creator cancels offer and retrieves locked tokens  
- **How it works**: Requires valid signature and NFT ownership  
- **Result**: Offer closed, assets returned

#### `redeem_after_timeout`
- **Purpose**: Safety function to reclaim tokens after expiration  
- **How it works**: Offerer can retrieve their tokens if deadline passed

**NFT Minting Logic**:
- One NFT minted per offer  
- Unique name: Original Token Name + Amount (e.g. `MAYZ-100`, `SNEK-1000`)

---

### 2. Security and Error Handling

- **Authorized Actions**: Only creator can cancel; acceptors must own the NFT  
- **Value Checks**: Asset amounts must match exactly  
- **Failure Handling**: Invalid actions revert; no unintended side effects  
- **Off-Chain Checks**: Frontend validates parameters before signing

---

### 3. Contract Dependencies

- Self-contained logic; no dependency on other MAYZ contracts  
- Requires `$MAYZ` utility token to create offers  
- Token dependency configurable during protocol setup  
- **Admin** and **Emergency** tokens allow upgrades, but cannot override or interfere with user-owned trades

---

### 4. Wallet & Ecosystem Integration

- **Wallet Support**: Compatible with Lace, Eternl, Nami, Gero (via Lucid & CIP-30)  
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/otc/create`
  - `/api/otc/claim`
  - `/api/otc/close`
  - `/api/otc/cancel`  
- **Token Standards**:
  - Uses CIP-20 for tokens
  - CIP-25 for NFT metadata
  - CIP-47 (inline datums), CIP-68 (reference scripts)
- **Marketplace Ready**: NFTs are tradable on Cardano platforms

---

### 5. Upgrade Path & Versioning

- **Approach**: Each offer is independent (via UTxO + NFT), enabling modular versioning  
- **Current Version**: Validator logic implemented as `validatorV1`  
- **How Updates Work**:
  - Future validators (`validatorV2`, etc.) can be added  
  - Clients switch via off-chain config without affecting past offers  
- **Governance Tokens**:
  - `EMERGENCY` and `ADMIN` tokens authorize edits
  - Cannot be used to seize funds or override trade logic
