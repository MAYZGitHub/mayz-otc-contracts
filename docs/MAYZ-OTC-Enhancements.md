## 1. Flexible Token Issuance

### Current Limitation

The current implementation only allows minting a single NFT representing the entire token deposit, which may limit trading flexibility for large positions.

### Proposed Enhancement

Introduce support for minting multiple Fungible Tokens (FTs) instead of a single NFT, allowing position creators to fragment their large positions into smaller, more tradeable units.

#### Implementation Details

- **Smart Contract Changes**:

```aiken
type OTCDatum {
    /// Existing fields
    ft_total_supply: Int,
    ft_tokens_per_unit: Int,
    is_fractional: Bool
}
```

- **Validation Rules**:
  - Total underlying tokens must equal `ft_total_supply * ft_tokens_per_unit`
  - Minimum size per FT unit to prevent dust
  - Maximum FT supply limit for efficiency

#### Benefits

- Improved liquidity through position fragmentation
- More accessible trading for smaller buyers
- Flexible exit strategies for large position holders

## 2. In-Contract Exchange Mechanism

### Current Limitation

OTC tokens must be traded on external marketplaces, adding complexity and potential friction to the trading process.

### Proposed Enhancement

Enable direct token exchanges within the OTC contract using either fixed prices or oracle-based pricing.

#### Implementation Details

```aiken
type OTCDatum {
  /// Existing fields
  price_in_ada: Int,
  price_valid_until: POSIXTime,
  use_oracle: Bool,
  oracle_config: Option<OracleConfig>,
  /// Track the number of sales for position analytics
  total_sales: Int,  
  /// Track total ADA volume for position analytics
  total_volume: Int  
}

type OracleConfig {
  oracle_policy_id: PolicyId,
  price_tolerance: Int,
  update_frequency: POSIXTime
}
```

#### Features

1. **Fixed Price Trading**
   - Creator sets ADA price per token
   - Direct purchase using contract endpoints
   - MAYZ token return on sale completed
   - Sales and volume tracking

2. **Oracle Integration** (Future Phase)
   - Price feeds from trusted oracles
   - Configurable price tolerance bands
   - Automatic price updates

## 3. Price Protection Mechanisms

### Proposed Enhancement

Implement time-based price validity and protection mechanisms to manage price volatility risks.

#### Features

- Automatic order suspension when price validity expires
- Configurable price bounds for oracle-based trading
- Grace period for price updates before order cancellation

## 4. Offers Contract

### Proposed Enhancement

Implement a dedicated contract for managing buy offers with locked ADA collateral.

#### Implementation Details

```aiken
type OfferDatum {
  otc_token_policy_id: PolicyId,
  otc_token_name: TokenName,
  /// Amount of OTC tokens requested
  tokens_requested: Int,      
  /// Price willing to pay per token  
  price_per_token: Int,   
  /// Total ADA amount locked (tokens_requested * price_per_token)     
  total_offer_amount: Int,     
  valid_until: POSIXTime,
  buyer_address: Address,
  offer_status: OfferStatus,
  /// Whether partial fills are accepted
  allow_partial: Bool         
}

type OfferStatus {
  Active | Expired | Canceled | Accepted | Partial | Accepted
}
```

#### Key Features

1. **Offer Creation**
   - Lock ADA with offer price per token
   - Set desired quantity of tokens
   - Enable partial fills if desired
   - Set validity period
   - Specify target OTC tokens

2. **Offer Management**
   - Update offer amount and price
   - Extend validity period
   - Cancel and reclaim ADA

3. **Offer Acceptance**
   - Full or partial token

## 5. MAYZ Token Management

### Current Limitation

MAYZ tokens remain locked until full position closure, limiting capital efficiency.

### Proposed Enhancement

Enable MAYZ token recovery when position is closed through direct exchange. If ADA from a direct sale is present in the contract, the creator can recover their MAYZ tokens without requiring the OTC NFT, since the presence of sale proceeds indicates successful position closure.

### Benefits of Direct Exchange vs External Marketplaces

The direct exchange mechanism provides a crucial advantage over traditional marketplace sales (like JPG Store). In the traditional approach, when a creator lists their OTC NFT on an external marketplace:

1. The NFT can be purchased and moved from the marketplace
2. The buyer may choose to never claim the underlying tokens from the OTC contract
3. As a result, the creator's MAYZ tokens remain permanently locked in the contract
4. There is no mechanism to verify if an external sale occurred or force token claiming

This creates a potential deadlock scenario where neither party can access the locked MAYZ tokens.

By implementing direct exchange within the contract:

- Sales and token claims happen atomically
- MAYZ tokens can be released upon successful sale
- No risk of permanent MAYZ token locking
- Clear verification of sale completion through ADA presence

## 6. Order and Offer Updates

### Proposed Enhancement

Implement comprehensive update mechanisms for both OTC orders and offers.

#### Features

1. **Order Updates**
   - Price adjustments
   - Validity period extensions
   - Partial cancellations for fractional positions

2. **Offer Updates**
   - Price modifications
   - Validity extensions
   - Partial offer adjustments
